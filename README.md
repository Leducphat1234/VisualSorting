# Sorting visualizer
There's an input form to enter a number `n` (`n` â‰¤ 1000000), once you click on `submit n`, it should create `n` blue bars with random height.
Next, you can choose a few sorting algorithms to sort.
You can also set the speed to clearly see how they work.
If you wish just a few bars, you can increase the `bar width` slider or decrease it to see more bars.
This page is suitable for people who are new to DSA and want to see how sorting work.
